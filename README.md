A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.

A computer is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions through integrated hardware and software components. It works with the help of programs and represents the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. It also has a memory that stores the data, programs, and result of processing. The components of a computer such as machinery that includes wires, transistors, circuits, hard disk are called hardware. Whereas, the programs and data are called software.

## What Does Computer Mean?

A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It has the ability to accept data (input), process it, and then produce outputs.

Computers can also store data for later uses in appropriate storage devices, and retrieve whenever it is necessary.

Modern computers are electronic devices used for a variety of purposes ranging from browsing the web, writing documents, editing videos, creating applications, playing video games, etc.

They are designed to execute applications and provide a variety of solutions by combining integrated hardware and software components.

## Benefits of Using a Computer

* **Increases your productivity:** A computer increases your productivity. For example, after having a basic understanding of a word processor, you can create, edit, store, and print the documents easily and quickly.

* **Connects to the Internet:** It connects you to the internet that allows you to send emails, browse content, gain information, use social media platforms, and more. By connecting to the internet, you can also connect to your long-distance friends and family members.

* **Storage:** A computer allows you to store a large amount of information, e.g., you can store your projects, ebooks, documents, movies, pictures, songs, and more.

* **Organized Data and Information:** It not only allows you to store data but also enables you to organize your data. For example, you can create different folders to store different data and information and thus can search for information easily and quickly.

* **Improves your abilities:** It helps write good English if you are not good at spelling and grammar. Similarly, if you are not good at math, and don't have a great memory, you can use a computer to perform calculations and store the results.

* **Assist the physically challenged:** It can be used to help the physically challenged, e.g., Stephen Hawking, who was not able to speak used computer to speak. It also can be used to help blind people by installing special software to read what is on the screen.

* **Keeps you entertained:** You can use the computer to listen to songs, watch movies, play games and more.

## What are the parts of a computer?

A computer has four main components: a CPU, a graphics processing unit (GPU), random access memory (RAM), and either a solid state drive (SSD) or a hard disk drive (HDD). All of these components are connected to a motherboard. Typically, the GPU and CPU comprise the computerâ€™s chipset. The memory (RAM) and storage (SSD/HDD) components are typically easier to modify or replace than the chipset

## What are the diffrent types of computer?

* As referenced below, there are six core classifications of computers:
* Microcomputers, or personal computers
* Minicomputers
* Mainframe computers
* Supercomputers
* Workstation computers
* Servers
